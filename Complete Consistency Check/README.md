Complete Consistency Check
---

Complete Consistency Check (CCC) is a tool developed within US ATLAS to
perform consistency checking between ATLAS dataset and file catalogs and local stroage. Currently
supported systems are DQ2, Rucio, generic disk, and dCache (PNFS/Chimera).
Support for LFC has been deprecated.

`ccc_pnfs_rucio.py` will download the list of datasets listed in DQ2 for a site, compute
Rucio paths for each file in the datasets, and check that against what is in PNFS. It will 
additionally check PNFS against disk. A report is generated in the output directory with a 
summary of discrepancies found.

`ccc_generic.py` checks a list of datasets in DQ2 against files on a generic mounted disk. It
is as of this writing not updated to compute Rucio paths.  Please contact support@mwt2.org
if you are interested in a version of ccc_generic.py that supports Rucio.

`ccc_pnfs.py` is a deprecated script that compares DQ2, LFC, and PNFS.  It is replaced by
`ccc_pnfs_rucio.py`.


How to run
----------

CCC requires the dq2 clients to be set up. See `ccc_wrapper.sh` for an example on an machine
with CVMFS.

The first time `ccc_pnfs_rucio.py` is run, it created a file ccc_config.py. You will need to 
edit this config file with the details of your site. See the example ccc_config.py. 

```
Usage: ./ccc_pnfs_rucio.py [-o output_dir] [-p pnfs_file] [-l lfc_file] [-np] [-nd] [-nl]
   normal usage requires no options
   -m min_age: don't flag files newer than this (default=2 hours)
         use 's' for seconds(default), 'm'=minutes, 'h'=hours, 'd'=days
         Used to avoid flagging files that are recently created and not yet registered.
   -o specifies directory for (html) output, default is working directory
   -p pnfs_file reads pnfsDump output from file, instead of 
         using ssh to run pnfsDump on the pnfs server
   -np (no pool) skips checking of /dcache/pool on pool nodes
   -nd (no dq2) skips checking of registered dq2 datasets
```

See `ccc_wrapper.sh` for an example of how to run `ccc_pnfs_rucio.py`.

Created files
-------------

The script will create a directory `/var/tmp/dq2/` and use it to cache dq2 responses. As this cache is 
filled out the run time of the script will improve.

A text file `/tmp/ccc.lock` is created to make sure only one copy of ccc runs at a time.

An html report named `ccc-DATE-TIME.html` will be created in the output directory, along with text files
for each of the file states detected. For instance, if there are pnfs orphans, the file pnfs-orphans-DATE-TIME
is created.

Concepts and terminology
------------------------

When the storage catalog systems are compared they are organized in a heirarchy, from highest to lowest
level, that being closest to physical disk.  In order these are DQ2 -> Rucio File Catalog ->
PNFS -> filesystem.  

GHOST: A file that is present in a higher level storage catalog, but not in a lower one or on disk.
Ghost files often cause job failures when a job runs at the site and fails to fetch the missing input
file.

ORPHAN: A file that is missing in the higher level storage catalog, but is present in the lower one or
on disk.  Orphans do not cause job failures.  They are typically 'dark data', and may need to be
removed manually.  

DAMAGED DATASET: A dataset that is listed as haing a complete replica at the site, but lower level
catalogs or disk show missing files.  Damaged datasets may cause job failures, for the same reason
as ghost files.

MISSING DATASET: A dataset that is listed as haing a complete replica at the site, but lower level
catalogs or disk show all files are missing.  Missing datasets may cause job failures, for the same reason
as ghost files.

INCOMPLETE DATASET: A dataset is listed as having a incomplete replica at the site, and the lower
level catalog and file system confirm that.  These are not a problem. 

EMPTY DATASET: A dataset listed as having 0 files in the catalog. These are not a problem.

UNKNOWN DATASET: The catalog lists the dataset as present at the site, but when the catalog was
queried for a list of files it returned an 'unknown dataset' error.  If a dataset appears in this
catagory repeatedly it may be broken in the catalog and need attention by the catalog admins.

OK DATASET:  A dataset that is listed as haing a complete replica at the site, and the lower level
catalogs and file system show all files present. Most datasets should be in this category.
